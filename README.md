Binary System Counter using Arduino
This repository contains a binary system counter that counts from 0 to 32 using Arduino. The counter is implemented using the Arduino IDE and can be uploaded to any Arduino board.

How it works
The binary system counter consists of 6 LEDs, each representing a bit in the binary count. The counter starts at 0 and increments by 1 on each button press until it reaches 32, at which point it resets back to 0.

Getting started
To use the binary system counter, you will need an Arduino board and the Arduino IDE. Here are the steps to upload the code to your Arduino board:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com//.git
Open the binary_system_counter.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
Select your Arduino board and port in the Arduino IDE.
Upload the code to your Arduino board.
Pinout
The LEDs are connected to the following pins on the Arduino board:

LED0: Pin 2
LED1: Pin 3
LED2: Pin 4
LED3: Pin 5
LED4: Pin 6
LED5: Pin 7
Contributing
